# Restaurant-Revenue-Prediction
Revenue Prediction Project
This project focuses on predicting revenue for restaurants using machine learning techniques. Key aspects include:
  - Data analysis of restaurant sales data, including the number of items sold, orders placed, and the distribution of revenue.
  - Data preparation by handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables for modeling.
  - Feature engineering to create meaningful inputs for the prediction model.
  - Model building using linear regression to predict revenue based on the available features.
  - Model evaluation using RÂ² score and other metrics to assess the accuracy and performance of the prediction model.
    
This project applies various preprocessing techniques and a machine learning approach to accurately predict restaurant revenue.
